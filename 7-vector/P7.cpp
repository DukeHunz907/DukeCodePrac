//Write a program that receives two sequence of numbers and put them in two vectors from the input (each sequence ends when 0 is entered) 
//and the use the vectors to check if they have the same elements (in any order). 
//Example input: 12, 2, 5, 9,0, 2, 9, 5, 12, 0
//Output: Yes

#include <vector>
