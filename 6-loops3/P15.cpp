//Create a C++ program that receives a sentence from the user and encrypts it using a simple substitution cipher. In this cipher, each character's position is 
//swapped with the position of the next character in the string. If the string has an odd number of characters, the last character remains in its original position.
//Example: Input: "hello world" Output: "ehll oowlrd"
