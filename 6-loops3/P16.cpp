//Write a C++ program that receives a string of digits as input. The program should keep each digit only if it is smaller than all the subsequent digits in the string. 
//All other digits should be removed. The order of the remaining digits should be preserved.
//Example: Input: "547839216" Output: "16"
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

    cout << "Enter a string of numbers: " << endl;
