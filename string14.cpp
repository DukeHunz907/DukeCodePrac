//First Rank: Create a program that receives a sentence from the user including a set of first names separated by space and prints out the name that
//would show up first in alphabetical order. You can assume no two names in the list share the same first character. Example: if the input is "John Lauren
//Samuel Nicholas Eva", the output should be "Eva".
